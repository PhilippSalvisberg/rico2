RICO v2 by Kamil Stawiarski (@ora600pl | www.ora-600.pl)
This is open source project to map BBED functionality.
If you know how to use BBED, you will know how to use this one.
Not everything is documented but in most cases the code is trivial to interpret it.
So if you don't know how to use this tool - then maybe you shouldn't ;)

Usage: python2.7 rico2.py listfile.txt
The listfile.txt should contain the list of the DBF files you want to read

## !!! CAUTION !!!!

This tool should be used only to learn or in critical situations!
The usage is not supported!
If found on production system, this software should be considered as malware and deleted immediately!

This tool is NOT based on reverse engineering - so RICO2 is just a set of my ideas of how the database block works, based on official materials. If you want to use this tool - use it at your own risk. 

If you want to know what to do with this tool, read this blog post:
